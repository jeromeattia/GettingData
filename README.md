Use the script file run_analysis.R to obtain a tidy dataset from the Human Activity Recognition version1 Dataset.

The creation of a directory "GettingData" in your HOME folder is optional (and commented out) as is the downloading of the data. Anyway, the data should be in a folder located in your working directory and named **UCI HAR Dataset**, as it is normally after unzip.

The only required package is **dplyr**, to be installed before running the script.

The file **CodeBook.md** explain the transformations made to the data to obtain the tidy dataset in the end, named **tidy_data** and exported as **tidy_data.txt**.
